# Plan
1.  Theoretical part
	1.  What is algorithmic trading (long term strategies, intraday algorithms, long term strategies, high frequency trading)
	2.  Main theorems (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, martingales and conditional expectation). All basic theorems and properties needed for further analysis.
	3.  Stationarity and ergodicity. Definition and usage examples
	4.  Time series analysis approach. Filtering problem, semi-martingales and processes of bound variation.

3.  Practical part
	1.  work out trading algorithms based on theoretical concepts provided
	2.  Use them on real historical data
	3.  Evaluate and analyse all basic performance indicators
